# 3720 Twitter API Example

This project works with the wonderful PHP Wrapper [TwitterAPIExchange.php](https://github.com/j7mbo/twitter-api-php) by [James Mallison](https://www.j7mbo.com/) (J7mbo) 

I am running out of time and I have to upload this before I am actually done so it will be full of wishes, hopes and the like.  

My project looks at the hashtag, “Earthday”. Since it is now April, I thought that I would take a look at it and maybe remind the class that it is coming up. I had difficulties working with the Twitter API and couldn’t figure out how to use the data.  The plan if I can figure it out in time is to make the flowers that appear, from clicking the seedling, correspond with the width of the numbers of retweets and likes that the list of tweets that also appear. This way the flowers will be different sizes, and may change depending on how much time does between refreshing the page. It would also be neat if I could figure out how to make it so that when you clicked the word earth day it would make a flower appear instead of the seedling. 

I also added some songs that found from https://www.timeout.com/newyork/music/best-earth-day-songs that are said to be good Earth day songs.
